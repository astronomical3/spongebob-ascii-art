# Contribution Guidelines for the Spongebob ASCII Art Repository on GitHub

Both original and copied ASCII art is accepted here in this repository.  This is an open-source repo.  You can either choose to contribute directly to this repo, or you can fork and clone and make pull requests to this repo if you don't want to contribute directly, I don't mind.

This repository is for all who know _Spongebob Squarepants_ and the impact that this show -- probably one of the greatest cartoon shows in television history -- has had on people around the world.  We want to fill this repo with the same joy and exuberance that makes Spongebob one of the most beloved cartoon characters ever.

Therefore, all contributions on this repo are to follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), so we can maintain a repository where all are safe to contribute their art.

# Just some suggestions:

1. Sign off your commits using `git commit -sm <message>`. üñãÔ∏è  You will see the sign off when you use the regular `git log` command.
2. Look at `git log` or `git log --oneline` for how to craft a commit message.  This is supposed to be fun and enjoyable, so be sure to give us some funny Spongebob references in your commits! üòÜ

# A few things I cannot stress enough:

1. PLEASE DO NOT SPEW RACIST, SEXIST, AGEIST, ABLEIST, XENOPHOBIC, ANTISEMITIC, ISLAMOPHOBIC, ANTI-LGBTQ+, ETHNOCENTRIC, WHITE COLONIALIST, AND/OR ANTI-NEURODIVERGENT SENTIMENT.  IN FACT, NO OPPRESSIVE SENTIMENT OF ANY KIND!
2. MORE ABOUT ANTI-NEURODIVERGENT SENTIMENT:

   - As I am starting up this repo (March 2023), "Autism Awareness Month" is just around the corner.  So, being Autistic (and self-diagnosed ADHDer), I need to stress about the concept of anti-Neurodivergence, because it may not be well-understood yet in the mainstream.
   - This regards any sentiment or actions that deprives Neurodivergent people (a subset of the larger Disabled population that includes individuals who are Autistic, ADHDer, Dyslexic, Dyscalculic, Dyspraxic, Dysgraphic, Tourette's, etc.) of their dignity and their basic human freedoms.
   - Please do not spread any sentiment that is in favor of Autism Speaks or any of the so-called "autism advocacy groups."  They are organizations that generally do not consult Autistic people, nor historically have had leadership and executive boards that are largely run by Autistic people.  That is anti-Autistic and anti-Neurodivergent by itself.
   - Please do not show off the blue puzzle piece logo, or an autism awareness ribbon.  Again, these "autism awareness" symbols did NOT come about with the consent of Autistic people themselves.  These symbols make us feel inferior and that we are mysterious beings, or monsters, or something along those lines.  No, no, no, we're human beings, just like you.
   - Instead, we encourage the use of colors such as red or gold, and also the use of the infinity sign ‚ôæÔ∏è, as they all have become the accepted signs and colors for Neurodiversity and the Autistic/Neurodivergent Rights movement.
   - Members of the [Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN)](https://autisticadvocacy.org), [Autistic Women &amp; Nonbinary Nework (AWN)](https://awnnetwork.org), corporate Neurodiversity employee resource groups, and other various self-advocacy and support groups across all historically marginalized groups are allowed to join this repo, and are allowed to contribute to future contribution guidelines here as this repo progresses.  That way, we maintain a very respectable repository and give those who feel they don't have a safe space in the mainstream one here on GitHub.
3. DO NOT MOCK PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS!

   - You do not know if any contributors here have had to go through a mental health situation.  Please show them courtesy and respect.
   - Again, we want to be able to give those who feel they don't have a safe space one right here on GitHub.
4. DO NOT MOCK PEOPLE WHO MAY BE NEW TO GIT AND GITHUB!

   - I just want to get it out there that I work in the tech industry, and I am an engineer.  Recently, I have been seeing people who are experienced in different specialties in the tech industry act cruelly towards those who may be new to a skill or specialty on sites such as Stack Overflow.  Believe me, I do not want any of that toxicity on my repos, because I do not tolerate it at work and in my personal life, either.
   - Just please use common courtesy and treat those who may be new to Git and GitHub with the utmost respect.
5. IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.

   - If you witness or experience a violation of the [Contribution Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), or of these Contributing Guidelines, please be sure to let me know via my email (astrobrunner@gmail.com), and I will do my best to take care of that.
